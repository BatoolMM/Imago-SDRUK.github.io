"data_catalogue": major

This implements authentication and authorisation for the data catalogue. Previous instances will have to be redeployed from scratch as permissions are not bootstraped. File handling is improved with versioning but updating a file version is currently not implemented in the frontend. There is no JWT/Token authorisation. Scripts and variables must be updated before redeploying
