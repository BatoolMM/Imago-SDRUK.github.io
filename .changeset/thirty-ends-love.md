Add functional search making use of ckan endpoints for solr. Will have to evaluate feature pairity with ckan /dataset and /search, and try implement the current functionality for search in our /datasets to enable filtering with the required/enabled filters.

Also add resource page, match auth /login layout, add handling search params from client and on the server, improve ui.
