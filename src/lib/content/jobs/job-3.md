This is an exciting opportunity for a postdoctoral researcher assistant (PDRA) to work with in the new Imagery Smart Data Service (Imago), one of a family of data services funded by E.S.R.C’s Smart Data Research UK programme. Imago is led by the University of Liverpool and in partnership with Newcastle University. We aim to radically transform the usability, utility, and usage of satellite imagery in social science, public health and policy making. The PDRA will work with the team and collaborate with data, distribution and application partners to unlock the potential of satellite imagery to solve some of the most urgent challenges facing the UK – especially where environmental vulnerability, urban development and housing, and health and wellbeing are concerned.

The PDRA will work closely with the service co-directors (Professor. Arribas-Bel and Franklin), the rest of academic co-investigators, research software engineers and professional support, and will be part of the Geographic Data Science Lab at the University of Liverpool.

The School of Environmental Sciences is an Athena SWAN Silver Award holder. We particularly welcome applications from scholars who identify with groups who continue to be underrepresented and who face barriers to inclusion in higher education. We believe that a diverse and supportive environment, bringing different perspectives to our work and allowing people to blossom is the best platform.

If you require any further details on the role, please contact Professors [Dani Arribas-Bel](mailto:d.arribas-bel@liverpool.ac.uk) and [Rachel Franklin](mailto:Rachel.Franklin@newcastle.ac.uk).

**If you are still awaiting your PhD to be awarded you will be appointed at Grade 6, spine point 30. Upon written confirmation that you have been awarded your PhD, your salary will be increased to Grade 7, spine point 31.**
