This is an exciting opportunity for a Data Service Manager to work within the new Imagery Smart Data Service (Imago), one of a family of data services funded by ESRC’s Smart Data Research UK programme. Imago is led by the University of Liverpool and in partnership with Newcastle University. We aim to radically transform the ‘usability’, ‘utility’, and ‘usage' of satellite imagery in social science, public health and policy making. You will collaborate with data, distribution and application partners to unlock the potential of satellite imagery to solve some of the most urgent challenges facing the UK – especially where environmental vulnerability, urban development and housing, and health and wellbeing are concerned.

You will work closely with the service co-directors (Profs. Arribas-Bel and Franklin), will be supported by Outreach and Engagement and Partnerships and Impact officers, and will be part of the Professional Services team at the University of Liverpool.

**The post is available from 1st March 2025 until 28th February 2029.**
